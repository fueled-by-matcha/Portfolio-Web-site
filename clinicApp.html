        <h1>Clinic Wait Times Android Application</h1>
        <p>An application which is used to manage the various functions of a walk-in clinic was created with Android Studio in Java. 
            A user can have three different roles: administrator, employee, and patient. Each role has different functions that can only be 
            accessed by that particular role.  The administrator can manage services that can be offered to walk-in clinics and delete the 
            accounts of users. The employee can create accounts for a walk-in clinic, select services provided by the administrator, and 
            edit and view working hours of the walk-in clinic. The patient can create their own accounts, search for a walk-in clinic by 
            criteria (address, type of service, and working hours), check into a clinic, and rate their experience at the clinic. All 
            application data is stored in a firebase database and all unit testing was performed with Espresso UI testing.</p>
